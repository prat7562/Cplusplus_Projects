## Introduction
Lot of organisations find it difficult to keep track of their students/interns who do a lot of courses and calculate their scores at the end. To keep a track of lot of students is difficult, so we have created a simple application to keep track of all the students/inters who enrol for their courses and track their scores. Our application keeps track of all the students using their PS number(pay sheet) and calculate their grades based on their scores that they got on different courses. We also keep track of their courses through the courses id and name and finally we let them know whether they are eligible for GENESIS or not.
## Research:
Our application uses various concepts of C++ programming language like Object oriented programming and various standard template libraries like vectors, list, maps, set etc.
Using most of these concepts we try to create a scorecard of the candidates of STEPIN and check whether they are eligible for GENESIS or not. All the data about the candidates are put in a CSV file and from this file we take the data and do various operations and give the result.
## Defining our system:
Our application takes all the information of the students from a CSV file and using these data we do various operations to find the average score and grades of the students and check whether he/she is eligible for GENESIS or not. We use concepts like OOPS and STL to do the operations .
