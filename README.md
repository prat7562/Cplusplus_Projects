# Introduction
Our application takes all the information of the students and store in CSV file and using these data we do various operations to find the average score and check whether he/she is eligible or not. We use concepts like OOPS and STL to do the operations.


# Folder Structure
| Folder | Description                 |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| `1_Requirements`  |  Documents detailing requirements and research.     |
| `2_Design`       |  Documents containing design details and UML diagrams.               |
| `3_Implementation `     |         Codes and documentation.                    |
| `4_Test Plan` | Documents detailing test plan and procedures. |

# Challenges Faced and How was it Overcome
| No. | Challange | Solution |
|-----|-----------|----------|
|`1`|Google test cases were not passing|Rechecked the code and rectified the errors|
|`2`|Make File running error | Refered Make Documentation and rectified the errors|
|`3`|Control Flow in coding session | Trial and error method|
| `4` | STL implementation | Cpp referance guide and some resources|
